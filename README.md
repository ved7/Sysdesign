# System Design Learning Platform

## Overview

This project is a frontend-first platform built to help developers understand system design in a structured and practical way.

The focus is on breaking down complex concepts into simple, visual, and interview-oriented explanations. Instead of just theory, the platform aims to show *how systems actually work* and how to think during interviews.

## Why I Built This

While preparing for system design interviews, I noticed:

* Most resources are either too theoretical or too scattered
* There’s no clear learning path from basics → advanced topics
* Understanding *how to think* is more important than memorizing answers

So I built this to:

* simplify system design concepts
* provide a structured path
* make interview prep more practical

## What This App Does

* Covers core system design topics (scaling, caching, databases, etc.)
* Breaks down real-world systems (like URL shortener, chat apps, etc.)
* Focuses on interview thinking rather than just final answers
* Provides clean and minimal UI for distraction-free learning

---

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React.js
* **State Management**: (Context API / Redux – update if needed)
* **Styling**: CSS / Tailwind (update if needed)
* **Routing**: React Router

This project is currently frontend-focused, with scope to extend into full-stack later.

* Topic-wise breakdown of system design concepts
* Real-world system case studies
* Clean and intuitive UI
* Fast navigation and lightweight performance

## Future Improvements

* Add backend for user progress tracking
* Add interactive diagrams and visual simulations
* Add quizzes and interview practice mode
* Add bookmarking and personalized learning path
